    <h1>About me</h1>
    
<p> 
    If you somehow skipped over the home page, 
        Hello my name is Sean I was born on 
        December 22, 2006.</p>

<p>
    I  live in Brooklyn, New York, and have been 
       for my whole life. I'm currently A Senior at
        Benjamin Banneker Academy and spend half of 
        my school day at the Brooklyn STEAM Center.</p>

     <p> I am currently interested in the Majors 
        Cyber Security and Computer programming and I also like to learn 
        Cooking as my Secondary because of my love for cooking and learning 
        about New foods.</p>

        <h1>Interest</h1>

        <p> 
            Throughout my life, I've had multiple things I have had 
                    as an interest. One of these interests is Manga. Some of my favorite 
                    mangas are both Blue lock and One Punchman which have become pretty 
                    popular over the past few years which im happy to seem.</p>

<p> 
    For my whole life I have been an avid believer in God and that Jesus Christ and that 
        he died for our Sins. I hope that those that read this website and see this also try 
        and learn about Christ and what he has done for us </p>
